CoinedPValues
====================================

CoinedPValues C++ Class
------------------------------------

The C++ source code implemented is design to combine independent
P-values weighted or not weighted. The C++ code provides the user 
with four functions used to combine P-values:
Fisher's, Good's, Mathai's and our own function which 
is numerically stable even when the
weights are identical or numerically close to one another. 
The various available functions can be found in the header file
CoinedPValues.h and the implementation of the functions can be found 
in CoinedPValues.cpp file. We also provide the user with an example
file (Example_CoinedPValues.cpp) to demonstrate how to call
the various functions.

Compiling
-------------------------------------

The source code for the standalone version can be easily compiled
with the following command in Linux.
$ g++ -Wall -c CoinedPValues.cpp
The above command will generate the object file (.o) which can be later linked to the main code as shown below.
$ g++ -Wall main_code_name.cpp CoinedPValues.o -o main_code_name -lm
